## New allocatable features

Take two integer arrays and try
* Automatic allocation
* Automatic resizing
* Allocating an array in a function
* Moving an allocation from an allocated an initialized array to an
  unallocated array.
   
Give a try also for the “allocatable scalar” feature by defining an
allocatable character string and allocating and initializing it in one
go.
