## Linked list

Complete the linked list data structure and associated type-bound
procedures for `append`, `get` and `finalizer`. Also, implement a
procedure that checks whether or not the keys in a given linked list
are in ascending order. 

Hint: implement the `<` operator for a node. The finalizer should
print the key-data pair of each node as it deallocates them.
