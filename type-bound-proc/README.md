## Type-bound procedures

Skeleton files together with a Makefile can be found from exercise folder.

1. Add functions created in the exercise [Abstract interfaces and
   procedure pointers](../abstract-interfaces) as type-bound
   procedures of the given vector type.
1. Implement operators for the type-bound procedures that you
   implemented in part 1. Note that you can also use operator names like
   `.prod.` in addition to `*`.
