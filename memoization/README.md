## Memoization

Fill in the type declaration `data_t` and functions `initdata` and
`calcdata` so that the data structure acts as a memoized sum of two
integers used as shown in the main program. Use the `initdata` as an
initializer for the `data_t` structure. Skeleton files for this
exercise are provided in the exercise  folder.
